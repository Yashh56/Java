Recursion is a process that involves a function calling itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. The function that performs the recursion process is called a recursive function. 

Recursion is a powerful tool in writing algorithms. It involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller sub-problems until it can be solved trivially. This is done by the program calling itself to repeat the same steps. 

Recursion can be used to solve certain problems easily. For example, recursion can be used to generate the set of all natural numbers. 

Recursion comes directly from Mathematics, where there are many examples of expressions written in terms of themselves. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as: F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2).
